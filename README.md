# CS Assessment Practice

This repo contains a Javascript fullstack CRUD applicatiom broken into fundamental components that can be used during APCs.

### Components are as follows:

- creating a server in Express.js and best practice for error handling
- connecting the frontend and backend with an index.html, index.js, and styles.css in vanilla JS
- creating a PostgresQL database and programmatically setting up tables using node scripts
- establishing endpoints for basic CRUD functionality with the database and testing with Postman
- building middleware for CRUD functionality and how to incorporate that into Express routes
- vanilla DOM manipuation
- sending data from the client to the server with fetch
